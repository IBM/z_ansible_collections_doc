IBM Z System Automation
=======================
The **IBM Z System Automation collection**, also represented as `ibm_zos_sysauto`_ in this document,
is  part of the broader initiative to bring Ansible Automation to IBM Z® through the offering
**Red Hat® Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z®**.

The **IBM Z System Automation collection** supports operational tasks using the IBM Z System Automation Operations API
such as creating and deleting `dynamic resources`_ from a template defined in the current active policy of an `IBM Z System Automation`_ environment.

The Ansible roles in this collection are written in Ansible and interact with the `Operations REST server component`_ of IBM Z System Automation.
