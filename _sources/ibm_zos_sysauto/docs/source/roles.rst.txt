Roles
===================

The **IBM Z System Automation collection** contains roles that can be used in a playbook to create and resume, and to delete dynamic
resources in an environment that is automated by `IBM Z System Automation`_. These roles greatly simplify the use of the services provided
by the IBM Z System Automation Operations REST server in custom playbooks.

The **IBM Z System Automation collection** provides two roles. Reference material for each role contains documentation on how to
use certain roles in your playbook.
