Requirements
============

A control node is any machine with Ansible installed. From the control node,
you can run commands and playbooks from a laptop, desktop, or server.
However, you cannot run **IBM z/OS core collection** on a Windows system.

A managed node is often referred to as a target node, or host, and it is managed
by Ansible. Ansible need not be installed on a managed node, but SSH must be
enabled.
