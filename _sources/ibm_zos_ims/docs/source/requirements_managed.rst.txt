Managed node
============

The managed z/OS node is the host that is managed by Ansible, as identified in
the Ansible inventory. The managed node has dependencies that are specific
to each release of the **IBM z/OS IMS collection**. Review the details of the
dependencies before you proceed to install the IBM z/OS IMS collection.

* `IBM Open Enterprise Python for z/OS`_
* `z/OS`_ V2R5 - V3Rx
* `IBM Z Open Automation Utilities`_ (ZOAU)

  * IBM z/OS IMS collections are dependent on specific versions of ZOAU.
    For information about the required version of ZOAU, review the
    `release notes`_.

* `z/OS OpenSSH`_
* The z/OS shell
* `IBM IMS V15 or later`_

.. note::

   Only the `z/OS shell`_ is supported, using ``ansible_shell_executable``
   to change the default shell is unsupported. Other shells are not supported
   because they handle the reading and writing of untagged files differently.

**IBM Open Enterprise Python for z/OS** which is ported for the z/OS platform
and required by **IBM z/OS IMS Collection**.

**Installation**

* Visit the `IBM Open Enterprise Python for z/OS`_ product page for FMID,
  program directory, fix list, latest PTF, installation and configuration
  instructions.
* For reference, the Program IDs are:

  * 5655-PYT for the base product
  * 5655-PYS for service and support
* Optionally download **IBM Open Enterprise Python for z/OS**, `here`_
* For the Python supported version, refer to the `release notes`_.
