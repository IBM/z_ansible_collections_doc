Releases
========

Version 1.3.0-beta.1
====================

What's New
----------

* Modules

  * ``zos_apf`` - Add or remove libraries to and from Authorized Program Facility (APF).
  * ``zos_backup_restore`` - Backup and restore data sets and volumes.
  * ``zos_blockinfile`` - Manage block of multi-line textual data on z/OS.
  * ``zos_find`` - Find matching data sets.
  * ``zos_data_set`` - added support to allocate and format zFS data sets

* Playbooks

  * In each release, we continue to expand on the use cases and deliver
    several new playbooks in the `playbook repository`_ that can be easily
    tailored to any system.

    * Authorize and
      `synchronize APF authorized libraries on z/OS from a configuration file cloned from GitHub`_
    * Automate program execution with
      `copy, sort and fetch data sets on z/OS playbook`_.
    * Automate user management with add, remove, grant permission,
      generate passwords, create zFS, mount zFS and send email
      notifications when deployed to Ansible Tower or AWX with the
      `manage z/OS Users Using Ansible`_ playbook.
    * Use the `configure Python and ZOAU Installation`_ playbook to scan the
      **z/OS** target to find the latest supported configuration and generate
      `inventory`_ and a `variables`_ configuration.
    * All playbooks have been updated to use our temporary data set feature
      to avoid any concurrent data set name problems.
    * In the prior release, all sample playbooks previously included with the
      collection were migrated to the `playbook repository`_. The
      `playbook repository`_ categorizes playbooks into **z/OS concepts** and
      **topics**, it also covers `playbook configuration`_ as well as provide
      additional community content such as **blogs** and where to open
      `support tickets`_ for the playbooks.

* Bug Fixes

  * Modules

    * Module ``zos_copy`` was updated to fail gracefully when a it
      encounters a non-zero return code.
    * Action plugin ``zos_copy`` was updated to support Python 2.7.
    * Module ``zos_tso_command`` support was added for when the command output
      contained special characters.
    * Module ``zos_job_submit`` referenced a non-existent option and was
      corrected to **wait_time_s**.

* Documentation

  * All documentation related to `playbook configuration`_ has been
    migrated to the `playbook repository`_. Each playbook contains a README
    that explains what configurations must be made to run a sample playbook.
  * We have been carefully reviewing our users feedback and over time we have
    compiled a list of information that we feel would help everyone and have
    released this information in our new `FAQs`_.
  * Learn about the latest features and experience them before you try
    them through the blogs that discuss playbooks, modules, and use cases:

    * `Running Batch Jobs on z/OS using Ansible`_ details how
      to write and execute batch jobs without having to deal with JCL.

    * `z/OS User Management With Ansible`_ explains all about the user management
      playbook and its optional integration into AWX.

Availability
------------

* `Galaxy`_
* `GitHub`_

Reference
---------

* Supported by `IBM Open Enterprise Python for z/OS`_ 3.8.2 or later
* Supported by IBM `Z Open Automation Utilities 1.1.0`_

  .. note::
     There is an additional step for `Z Open Automation Utilities 1.1.0`_ (ZOAU)
     over prior installations of ZOAU on the target z/OS. After you have
     `configured IBM Open Enterprise Python on z/OS`_ **environment variables**
     on the z/OS target and have installed ZOAU from a PAX archive or through
     SMPe, you will need to perform a PIP installation of the ZOAU Python
     libraries and ensure you have either exported or added these environment
     variables to your **z/OS** host **.profile**.

     **Variables**:

     | ``export ZOAU_HOME=/usr/lpp/IBM/zoautil``
     | ``export PATH=${ZOAU_HOME}/bin:$PATH``
     | ``export LIBPATH=${ZOAU_HOME}/lib:${LIBPATH}``

     **PIP installation command**:

     | ``pip install zoautil_py-1.1.0.tar.gz``.

     This will install the ZOAU Python libraries on the **z/OS** target for use
     by **z/OS Ansible core** and other collections.

     However, the Python installation may not have the the symbolic link for
     ``pip`` in which case you can use ``pip3`` to install the libraries:

     | ``pip3 install zoautil_py-1.1.0.tar.gz``.

     If the Python installation has not installed the ``wheel`` packaging
     standard and not updated the ``pip`` version to the latest, the warning
     messages can be ignored.

     **Example output**:

      | Processing ./zoautil_py-1.1.0.tar.gz
      | Using legacy setup.py install for zoautil-py, since package 'wheel' is
       not installed.
      | Installing collected packages: zoautil-py
      | Running setup.py install for zoautil-py ... done
      | Successfully installed zoautil-py-1.1.0
      | WARNING: You are using pip version 20.1.1; however, version 20.2.4 is
       available.
      | You should consider upgrading via the
       '<python_path>/pyz_3_8_2/usr/lpp/IBM/cyp/v3r8/pyz/bin/python3.8 -m pip install --upgrade pip' command.

* Supported by `z/OS V2R3`_ or later
* The `z/OS® shell`_

Known issues
------------

* Modules

  * When executing programs using ``zos_mvs_raw``, you may encounter errors
    that originate in the implementation of the programs. Two such known issues are
    noted below of which one has been addressed with an APAR.

    #. ``zos_mvs_raw`` module execution fails when invoking
       Database Image Copy 2 Utility or Database Recovery Utility in conjunction
       with FlashCopy or Fast Replication.
    #. ``zos_mvs_raw`` module execution fails when invoking DFSRRC00 with parm
       "UPB,PRECOMP", "UPB, POSTCOMP" or "UPB,PRECOMP,POSTCOMP". This issue is
       addressed by APAR PH28089.
