====================
Get help and support
====================

If you experience any issues when you use the collections, there are different types of support available, depending on how you obtain the collections. We encourage you to always review the :ref:`faqs` in this documentation before you seek for further help.

----------------------------------------------------------
If you download collections through Ansible Automation Hub
----------------------------------------------------------

If you use a Red Hat® Ansible® Certified Content for IBM Z® collection and obtain that collection through Ansible Automation Hub (AAP), you are entitled to support for that collection from Red Hat or IBM® with your customer number.

To get official support, follow these procedures:
1. Create a support case with Red Hat through `Red Hat Customer Portal`_.
2. Red Hat will determine if the issue is IBM related. If it is, follow Red Hat's instruction to open a support case with IBM for the respective collection.
3. Red Hat support will review to determine if the issue is within the ansible-core engine or other Red Hat provided offerings (e.g. Ansible Tower).
4. Once the issue is determined to be in the scope of Red Hat® Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z, your interaction with the case will be handed off to IBM support.
5. The associated Red Hat case and IBM case will both remain active until the issue is resolved or case closure is agreed upon by both teams.

------------------------------------------------------------
If you download collections from Ansible Galaxy NG or GitHub
------------------------------------------------------------

If you use Ansible Galaxy NG or GitHub to get collections, official support will not be available in this case. Alternatively, you can engage with the community through `GitHub issues`_ or `GitHub discussions`_. However, these requests will be addressed as time permits depending on the team's availability.
