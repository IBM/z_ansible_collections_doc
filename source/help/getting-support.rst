Getting Support
===============

If you encounter issues while using Ansible for IBM Z collections,
you can access enterprise support from Red Hat and IBM or community support.

As certified content, the collections are entitled to enterprise support
from Red Hat to users of Ansible Automation Platform (AAP). If you obtain the
collections through AAP and have AAP entitlement for z/OS, you are eligible for
support from Red Hat and IBM. When Red Hat requests IBM involvement in the support
case, Red Hat will ask you to open a ticket with IBM as well.

If you obtain a collection from Ansible Galaxy or GitHub, you are **not**
entitled to official support, you can still engage the community by
`opening an GitHub issue`_ or through `GitHub discussions`_. From there,
the issue will be triaged and handled by the development teams.

Option 1: Support from Red Hat and IBM
--------------------------------------

    For support from Red Hat and IBM, we first encourage you to check GitHub issues
    or GitHub discussions to see if similar issues were raised before you open a support
    ticket.

    To get support from Red Hat and IBM, follow these procedures:

    #. Open a support case with Red Hat through `Red Hat Customer Portal`_.
       Red Hat Support will check your entitlement for support and decide if
       the issue belongs to IBM.

    #. If the issue requires IBM involvement, follow Red Hat's guidance to
       open a support case with IBM and provide the cross reference
       information to both, IBM and Red Hat.

    #. Both Red Hat and IBM will investigate the issue.

        - Red Hat Support will check if the issue is related to any AAP offering.
        - IBM Support will work with you to solve issues that are related to the collection.

    #. Your support cases with both teams are closed when the issue is resolved
       or a case closure is agreed upon by both teams.

    .. Note:: Do not open a support case with IBM without submitting a support request
       with Red Hat first.

    For a list of currently supported versions of each collection,
    see :ref:`collection-life-cycles`

Option 2: Support from the community
------------------------------------

    For support from the community, we first encourage you to check GitHub issues
    or discussions to see if similar issues were raised before you create an issue.

    Unlike enterprise support, community support only supports the collections which
    does not include any dependencies. Community support is triaged by the development
    team and prioritized accordingly. Because community support is public, all assets
    included are viewable by others, please sanitize any sensitive content.

    For issues related to the Ansible for IBM Z collections, raise a GitHub issue against the
    appropriate collection repository:

    * `IBM z/OS core <https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/new/choose>`_
    * `IBM z/OS CICS <https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_cics/issues/new/choose>`_
    * `IBM z/OS IMS  <https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_ims/issues/new/choose>`_
    * `IBM z/OS Sys Auto <https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_sysauto/issues/new/choose>`_
    * `IBM z/OSMF <https://github.com/IBM/ibm_zosmf/issues>`_
    * `IBM Z HMC <https://github.com/zhmcclient/zhmc-ansible-modules/issues>`_
