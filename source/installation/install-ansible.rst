Install Ansible
===============

Before installing an IBM z/OS® collection, you must make sure the required version of Ansible® is installed on your control node. You can check which Ansible version needs to be installed from :ref:`requirements`. Ansible's community packages are distributed in two ways: ``ansible`` or ``ansible-core``. For more information about which package to choose, see `Selecting an Ansible package and version to install`_.

The available installation options include:

- `Install Ansible with pipx`_
- `Install Ansible with pip`_

Additionally, you can Install Ansible to containers or Install Ansible for development. For more information, see `Install Ansible`_.

After you installed Ansible on the control node, make sure the installation is successful by `Confirm your installation`_.
