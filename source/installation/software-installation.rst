Software Installation
=====================

Ansible is agentless automation software that you install on a single host,
referred to as the :term:`control node<Control node>`. Ansible enables
cross-platform Automation and orchestration at scale and IBM's recommendation
for enterprise automation.

From the :term:`control node<Control node>`, Ansible can manage any number and
combination of Z systems, subsystems, instances and devices remotely with ``SSH``
and ``REST`` from a command-line interface or optionally, advanced orchestration
with Ansible Automation Platform.
