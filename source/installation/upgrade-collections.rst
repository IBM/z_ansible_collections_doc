=========================
Upgrade Ansible for IBM Z
=========================

**IBM Ansible for Z** collections are not automatically upgraded when newer
versions release. After you have installed an **Ansible IBM Z** collection,
you may need to upgrade the collection to leverage the benefits a new
collection is delivering.

To upgrade the collection to the latest available version, use the following
command syntax. To learn more about the namespace and collection name, see
:ref:`install a collection<install-collections>`.

    .. code-block:: sh

        ansible-galaxy collection install <namespace>.<collection name> --upgrade

.. note::

    This will also update the dependent collections unless ``--no-deps`` is provided.
