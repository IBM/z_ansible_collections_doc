============================
Install IBM z/OS collections
============================

After you've installed Ansible, you can install IBM z/OS collections with several options.

-------------
Prerequisites
-------------

Before installing any collection, you must make sure the collection requirements are meet through the use of `environment variables`_. The preferred configuration is to place the environment variables in ``group_vars`` and ``host_vars``, you can find examples of this configuration under **Configuration** of any project in the `Ansible Z Playbook Repository`_.

.. note::
    If you are testing a configuration, it can be helpful to set the environment variables in a playbook. See `How to put environment variables in a playbook`_.

To install ZOAU Python wheel, see `Python wheel installtion method`_.

---------------------------
Install with Ansible Galaxy
---------------------------

.. Ansible Galaxy includes the command to install the collection.
.. Users can either use the provided command from link xxx or follow the general flow.
.. After installation, verify with the command: ansible-galaxy collection list.
.. To delete a collection, navigate to the collection directory and run the command: rm -rf <path_to_collection_directory>/<collection_name>
.. Some collections have dependencies on other collections (e.g. IMS and core), if you install ims, ansible will install core for you as well
.. that's all for configuring control nodes. you also need to configure managed nodes before running ansible playbooks

Ansible Galaxy is the community repository for Ansible for IBM Z collections. Before using an IBM z/OS collection, you need to install it with the Ansible Galaxy command-line tool:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ ansible-galaxy collection install <namespace>.<collection name>

You can also include it in a ``requirements.yml`` file and install it with ``ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml``, using the format:

.. code-block:: sh
    collections:
      - name: <namespace>.<collection name>

The namespace for all Ansible for IBM Z collections is ``ibm``. You can select the collection name from: ``ibm_zos_core``, ``ibm_zos_ims``,
``ibm_zos_cics``, ``ibm_zhmc`` and ``ibm_zos_sysauto``.

Upgrade to the latest version
-----------------------------

If you install a collection from Ansible Galaxy, it will not be upgraded automatically when you upgrade the Ansible package. To upgrade the collection to the latest available version, run the following command:

.. code-block:: sh
    ansible-galaxy collection install <namespace>.<collection name> --upgrade

Install or downgrade to a specific version
------------------------------------------

You can install a specific version of the collection or downgrade to a lower version. For example, you can use the following command to install version 1.0.0 for the IBM z/OS core collection:

.. code-block:: sh
    ansible-galaxy collection install ibm.ibm_zos_core:1.0.0

You can also install a **beta version** of the collection. A beta version is only available on Ansible Galaxy and is only supported by the community before it becomes General Availability (GA). Use the following command to install a beta version for the IBM z/OS core collection:

.. code-block:: sh
    ansible-galaxy collection install ibm.ibm_zos_core:1.10.0-beta.1

For more information about installing Ansible collections, see `Installing collections (Ansible Documentation)`_.

----------------------------------------
Automation Hub and Private Galaxy server
----------------------------------------

(Jenny'comment: keep this section?)

The procedure of configuring access to a privcate Galaxy server is the same as that of connecting a client to Automation Hub. You can use the ``ansible-galaxy collection install`` command to install a collection on the control node hosted in Automation Hub or a private Galaxy server.

By default, ``ansible-galaxy`` uses ``https://galaxy.ansible.com`` as the Galaxy server, but you can configure the ``ansible-galaxy collection`` command to use other servers. For more information, see `Configuring the ansible-galaxy client (Ansible Documentation)`_.

For Automation Hub, you additionally need to:

  * Set the auth_url option for each server name.
  * Set the API token for each server name. For more information on API tokens,
    see `Get API token from the version dropdown to copy your API token`_.

.. _Get API token from the version dropdown to copy your API token:
   https://cloud.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/token/

.. note::

   When hosting a private Galaxy server or pointing to Hub, available content may not
   be always consistent with what is available on Ansible Galaxy server.

The following example shows a configuration for Automation Hub, a private
running Galaxy server, and Galaxy:

.. code-block:: yaml

   [galaxy]
   server_list = automation_hub, galaxy, private_galaxy

   [galaxy_server.automation_hub]
   url=https://cloud.redhat.com/api/automation-hub/
   auth_url=https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token
   token=<hub_token>

   [galaxy_server.galaxy]
   url=https://galaxy.ansible.com/

   [galaxy_server.private_galaxy]
   url=https://galaxy-dev.ansible.com/
   token=<private_token>

To learn more about configuration, see `Ansible Configuration Settings (Ansible Documentation)`_.

Local build
-----------

You can git clone the repository of a collection, and use the ``ansible-galaxy collection build`` command to build the collection into an archive that can be later install locally.

To build a collection from the Git repository:

   1. Git clone a collection repository:

      .. code-block:: sh

         $ git clone git@github.com:<path/to/repository>/<collection name>.git

   2. Enter the collection folder and build the collection archive:

      .. code-block:: sh

         cd <collection name>
         ansible-galaxy collection build

      Example output of a locally built collection:

      .. code-block:: sh

         $ ansible-galaxy collection build
         Created collection for ibm.<collection name> at /Users/user/git/ibm/zos-ansible/<collection name>/<collection name>-1.0.0.tar.gz

   .. note::

      * Collection archive names will change depending on the release version. The names adhere to this convention:

          **<namespace>-<collection>-<version>.tar.gz**, for example, **ibm-ibm_zos_core-1.0.0.tar.gz**

      * If you build a collection with Ansible version 2.9 or earlier, you may see the following warning that you can ignore:

         **[WARNING]: Found unknown keys in collection galaxy.yml at '/Users/user/git/ibm/zos-ansible/<collection name>/galaxy.yml': build_ignore**

   3. Install the locally built collection:

      .. code-block:: sh

         $ ansible-galaxy collection install ibm-<collection name>-1.0.0.tar.gz

      In the output of collection installation, note the installation path to access the sample playbook:

      .. code-block:: sh

         Process install dependency map
         Starting collection install process
         Installing 'ibm.<collection name>:1.0.0' to '/Users/user/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/ibm/<collection name>'

      You can use the ``-p`` option in the ``ansible-galaxy`` command to specify the installation path. For example:
      
      .. code-block:: sh

        $ ansible-galaxy collection install ibm-<collection name>-1.0.0.tar.gz -p /home/ansible/collections

    For more information, see `Installing a collection from a git repository (Ansible Documentation)`_.
