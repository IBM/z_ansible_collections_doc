============
Requirements
============

Before you install any IBM z/OS collection, you must configure a control node and
managed node with a minimum set of requirements. The following sections detail the
specific software requirements for the control and managed nodes.

Control node
============
A control node is any machine with Ansible installed. From the control node,
you can run commands and playbooks from a laptop, desktop, or server.
However, you cannot run a collection on a Windows system. All IBM z/OS collections
require the following these versions of software:

* `Ansible version`_: 2.9 or later
* `Python`_: 2.7 or later
* `OpenSSH`_

Managed node
============

A managed node is often referred to as a target node, or host, and it is managed
by Ansible. Ansible need not be installed on a managed node, but SSH must be
enabled. Each offering in the IBM z/OS collections varies in terms of the requirements for
the managed node. Select one of the following offerings to learn
more about the specific dependencies and required/supported software versions.
