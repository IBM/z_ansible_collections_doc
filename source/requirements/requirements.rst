Software requirements
=====================

Before you install an **Ansible for IBM Z** collection, you must configure
the :term:`control node<Control node>` and depending on the collection,
the :term:`managed node<Managed node>` with a minimum set of requirements.

Each Ansible for IBM Z collection, or each version of a collection can have
different requirements or dependencies. To find out more details, check the
following links for the specific collection.
