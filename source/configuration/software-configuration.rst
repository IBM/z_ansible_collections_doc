======================
Software Configuration
======================

Ansible is agentless automation software installed on the
:term:`control node<Control node>`. From the control node, Ansible will interact
with the :term:`managed node<Managed node>` remotely using
*SSH* and *REST* from a command-line interface or optionally, advanced
orchestration with Ansible Automation Platform.

The **Ansible for IBM Z** collections will require additional configuration
to ensure that **SSH** or **REST** endpoints are available and configured for
communication.

Here you will find instructions on how to configure **Ansible for IBM Z**
collections and perform a simple module test.
