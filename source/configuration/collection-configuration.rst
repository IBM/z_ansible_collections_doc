Prerequisites
=============
Before installing any collection, ensure the collection requirements are met through the use of `environment variables`_. The preferred configuration is to place the environment variables in ``group_vars`` and ``host_vars``, you can find examples of this configuration under **Configuration** of any project in the `Ansible Z Playbook Repository`_.

.. note::
    If you are testing a configuration, it can be helpful to set the environment variables in a playbook. See `How to put environment variables in a playbook`_.

To install ZOAU Python wheel, see `Python wheel installation method`_.
