Software Configuration
======================

Ansible is agentless automation software installed on the control node. From
the control node, Ansible will interact with the managed node remotely using
SSH and REST from a command-line interface or optionally, advanced
orchestration with Ansible Automation Platform.

The **Ansible for IBM Z** collections will require additional configuration
such that **SSH** or **REST** endpoints be available and configured for
communication.

Here you will find instructions on how to configure Ansible for IBM Z
collections and perform a simple module test.
