====================

If you experience an issue or have questions when using Red Hat® Ansible® Certified Content for IBM Z®, you can use the following resources before you open a support case.

- Review the FAQs in the product documentation.
- Get community support from 

If you couldn't find an answer or the community support couldn't solve your problem, you can get support from Red Hat and IBM by following the procedures:

1. Create a support ticket with Red Hat. 
2. Red Hat will assess if the issue involves ``ansible-core`` development.
3. If not, follow Red Hat's instructions to open a support ticket with IBM.

It's important to raise the issue to Red Hat for its awareness because the issue could be found in ``ansible-core``. It expedites both Red Hat and IBM to escalate and resolve the issue. If that's the case, Red Hat will evaluate entitlement and communicate to IBM after you open a support ticket with its support team.
