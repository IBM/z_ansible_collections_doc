Getting support
===============

If you encounter issues while using the Ansible® for IBM Z® collections,
you can look for official support or community support based on how you
obtained the collections.

As Red Hat® certified content, the collections are entitled to support
through Ansible Automation Platform (AAP). If you obtain the collections
through AAP and have AAP entitlement for z/OS, you are eligible for
support from Red Hat. When IBM® involvement is identified in this issue,
Red Hat will ask you to open a ticket with IBM as well.

If you obtain a collection from Ansible Galaxy or GitHub, you are **NOT**
entitled to official support, you can still engage the community by
`opening an GitHub issue`_ or through `GitHub discussions`_. From there,
the issue will be triaged and handled as time permits.

Support from Red Hat and IBM
----------------------------

We encourage you to check GitHub issues or GitHub discussions to see if
similar issues were raised before you open a support ticket. To get
support from Red Hat and IBM®, follow these procedures:

#. Open a support case with Red Hat through `Red Hat Customer Portal`_.
   Red Hat Support will check your entitlement for support and decide if
   the issue belongs to IBM.

#. If the issue requires IBM involvement, follow Red Hat's guidance to
   open a support case with IBM and provide the cross reference
   information to both, IBM and Red Hat.

#. Both Red Hat and IBM will investigate the issue.

    - Red Hat Support will check if the issue is related to any AAP offering.
    - IBM Support will work with you to solve issues that are related to
      the collection.

#. Your support cases with both teams are closed when the issue is resolved
   or a case closure is agreed upon by both teams.

.. Note:: Do not open a support case with IBM without submitting a
       request with Red Hat first.

For a list of currently supported versions of each collection,
see :ref:`Ansible Z life cycles`
