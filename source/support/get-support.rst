Getting support
===============

If you encounter issues while using the Ansible® for IBM Z® collections, you can look for official support or community support based on how you obtained the collections.

As Red Hat® certified content, the collections are entitled to support through Ansible Automation Platform (AAP). If you obtain the collections through AAP and get a customer number, you are eligible for support from Red Hat. When IBM® involvement is defined in this issue, Red Hat will ask you to open a ticket with IBM as well.

If you obtain a collection from Ansible Galaxy or GitHub, you are **NOT** entitled to official support, but you can still engage with the community by `opening an GitHub issue`_ or via `GitHub discussions`_. Depending on the team's availability, your request will be addressed as time permits.

Support from Red Hat and IBM
----------------------------

We encourage you to check GitHub issues or GitHub discussions to see if similar issues were raised before you open a support ticket. To get support from Red Hat and IBM®, follow these procedures:

#. Open a support case with Red Hat through `Red Hat Customer Portal`_. Red Hat Support will check your enitlement for support and decide if the issue belongs to IBM.

    .. Note:: Do not open a support case with IBM without submitting a request with Red Hat first.

#. If the issue requries IBM involvement, follow Red Hat's guidance to open a support case with IBM and provide the cross reference information with both sides.

#. Both teams from Red Hat and IBM will investigate on the issue.

    - Red Hat Support will check if the issue related to any Red Hat provided offerings.
    - IBM Support will work with you to solve issues that are related to the collection.

#. Your support cases with both teams are closed when the issue is resolved or a case closure is agreed upon by both teams.

For a list of currently supported versions of each collection, see the life cycle page of each collection.

Support from community
----------------------

For issues related to the Ansible collections, raise a GitHub issue against the appropriate collection repository:

  * `IBM z/OS core <https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/new/choose>`_
  * `IBM z/OS CICS <https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_cics/issues/new/choose>`_
  * `IBM z/OS IMS  <https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_ims/issues/new/choose>`_
  * `IBM z/OS Sys Auto <https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_sysauto/issues/new/choose>`_
  * `IBM z/OSMF <https://github.com/IBM/ibm_zosmf/issues>`_
  * `IBM Z HMC <https://github.com/zhmcclient/zhmc-ansible-modules/issues>`_


If you encounter a specific **CICS server-related issue**, raise a case against the CICS team as you would normally do with other CICS products.

  * For CICS collection-related issues, gather the CICS `MustGather`_ data before contacting
    the support team.
