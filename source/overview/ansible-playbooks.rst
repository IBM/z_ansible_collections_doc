Ansible playbooks
=================

To help you get started with Ansible® for IBM Z®, we provide a wide range of
ready-to-use sample playbooks in our `Ansible for IBM Z sample playbook repository`_
on GitHub. You can explore the sample playbooks in the repository and customize
them for your own use cases.

The playbook repository contains various playbooks catering to different
aspects of IBM Z. All the playbooks in the repository can run
independently from any other playbook. We provide detailed README files and
documentation in each playbook, and you can configure the playbook by following
the instructions in them.

The playbook repository is an open-source project, and the playbooks are
contributed by IBM and the broader Ansible community. If you need any support
while using a sample playbook, you should contact the playbook contributors
to request community support.

For example, you can find playbooks that demonstrate various topics such as:

* `Z Systems Administration`_
* `z/OS Administration`_
* `z/OS Basic Operations`_
* `z/OS Concepts`_
* `z/OS Integrating Existing Automation`_
* `z/OS Provisioning`_
* `z/OS Application & Service Deployment`_
* `z/OS Subsystems`_
* `z/OS Software Installation`_
