Playbooks
=========

The sample playbooks that are **included** in the **IBM z/OS collections**
demonstrate how to use the collection content.

Documentation
=============

An `Ansible playbook`_ consists of organized instructions that define work for
a managed node (host) to be managed with Ansible.

A `playbooks directory`_ that contains a sample playbook is included in the
**IBM z/OS core collection**. The sample playbook can be run with the
``ansible-playbook`` command with some modification to the **inventory**,
**ansible.cfg** and **group_vars**.

You can find the playbook content that is included with the collection in the
same location where the collection is installed. For more information, refer to
the `installation documentation`_. In the following examples, this document will
refer to the installation path as ``~/.ansible/collections/ibm/ibm_zos_core``.
