Sample playbook repository
==========================

To help you use Ansible® for IBM Z® more easily, we provide a wide range of
ready-to-use sample playbooks in our `Ansible for IBM Z sample playbook repository`_
on GitHub. You can leverage the sample playbooks in the repository or customize
them for your own use cases.

The sample playbook repository contains various playbooks catering to different
aspects of IBM Z management. All the playbooks in the repository can run
independently from any other playbook. We provide detailed README files and
documentation in each playbook, you can configure the playbook by following
the instructions in them.

The sample playbook repository is an open-source project, and the playbooks are
contributed by IBM and the broader Ansible community. If you need any support
while using a sample playbook, you should contact the playbook contributors
and get community support.
