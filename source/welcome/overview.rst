Ansible for IBM Z
=================

**Red Hat® Ansible® Certified Content for IBM Z®**
(also known as **Ansible for IBM Z**) is a suite of collections designed to
automate and manage IBM Z environments using Ansible, an open-source automation
platform. It provides a wide range of Ansible collections that are developed by
IBM® and certified by Red Hat.

It enables development, operations and automation on z/OS®, z/OS middleware
products, and other IBM Z systems and resources. The collections in
Ansible for IBM Z offer a seamless, unified workflow, orchestration with
configuration management, provisioning, and application deployment in
one easy-to-use platform.

Today, the available collections include:

- IBM z/OS core collection
- IBM z/OS CICS collection
- IBM z/OS IMS collection
- IBM Z System Automation collection
- IBM z/OS Management Facility collection
- IBM Z HMC collection

The Ansible for IBM Z teams are actively expanding the collections to
automate other common configuration and management tasks for software
in the broader IBM Z community.
